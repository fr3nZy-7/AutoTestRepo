API testing theory

verbs / methods
- GET - get method gives info
- POST - post method adds new record, PUT can also add a new record
- PUT - Put updates existing records
- DELETE - delete deletes a record


Before testing API we will be given a collection and a doc file. 

Doc file will tell us what is to be tested and how the collection needs to be used/tested.

A collection is a file that is a collection of end points/API/Request to be tested.
